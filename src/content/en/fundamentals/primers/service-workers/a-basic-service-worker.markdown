key-takeaways:
  tldr:   
  - "Call <code>register()</code> to get a service worker." 
  - "Learn to use promises before attempting service workers."
  - "Service workers have a limited scope and require HTTPS."
  - "The installation process has two events: install and activate."
  - "To start proxying, a service worker needs a call to <code>clients.claim()</code> or a user navigation."
  - "Pass a promise to <code>waitUntil()</code> to indicate success/failure of asynchronous tasks."
notes:
  promises:
    - "<b>Promises</b>&mdash;Notice the use of <code>.then()</code> at the end of the <code>register()</code> function. This is an example of an ECMAScript 2015 construct called a <a href='http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/'>promise</a>. Service workers make heavy use of promises. If you've never used promises before, you should familiarize yourself with them before trying to implement a service worker."
  https-only:
    - "<b>HTTPS Only</b>&mdash;Service workers can do almost whatever they want to HTTPS requests and responses. Since this would make them targets for man-in-the-middle attacks, they must be served over HTTPS. localhost is exempt from the HTTPS only rule, simplifying development and testing."
  sws-dont-control:
    - "<b>Service Workers Don't Take Control</b>&mdash;If you look around the web, you'll find that many of the pages discussing service workers refer to the service worker as 'taking control' of a page. But as we saw earlier, a service workers can't change a page's DOM. That's why it may be more accurate to think of a service worker as ready to proxy."

## A client registers a service worker

To use a service worker, a client tells the browser to install it by calling
`register()`. More than one page can implement `register()` because the
browser verifies existence of the service worker for you and only the first
call to `register()` triggers the service worker's download. The most basic 
register implementation looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Does the browser support service workers?
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Yes
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js').then(function() {
    // Actions not covered by this primer.
  });
} else {
  // No, but this client should work anyway.
};
{% endhighlight %}

There's more to learn about clients, but that's another lesson. Now let's 
talk about the service worker itself.

{% include shared/note.liquid list=page.notes.promises %}

## Where can the service worker play?

A client tells the service worker where it can operate. This is called the
service worker's scope, and it's the highest level of your website where the
service worker can be used. Let's look at the registration code again, but with
some changes to the `register()` parameters.

{% highlight javascript %}
// Does the browser support service workers?
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Yes
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {scope: '/'})
    .then(function() {
    // Actions not covered by this primer.
  });
} else {
  // No, but this client should work anyway.
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code is functionally identical to the example given in the last section. 
Both examples specify that the scope of the service worker is the entire domain. 
If you want to restrict the service worker to part of a site, simply specify it 
in the scope. 

For example, say that you have an auction site with different features for
buyers  and sellers. The buyers section is at `example.com/buyers` and the
sellers section  is at `example.com/sellers`. A service worker with a scope of
`/buyers` it can only  serve clients under `example.com/buyers`. It cannot serve
clients under  `example.com/sellers`. Similarly, a service worker with a scope
of `/sellers` can  only serve clients under `example.com/sellers`.

A less than obvious corollary of this that service workers can't be stored in 
an assets folder. For example a registration like this will always fail:

{% highlight javascript %}
register('/assets/js/service-worker.js', {scope: '/'})
{% endhighlight %}

For the scope of this service worker to be `/` it has to be served from 
`/service-worker.js`

{% include shared/note.liquid list=page.notes.https-only %}

## A service worker installs and activates

Letâ€™s look at what happens during the installation of the service worker. To set 
up a service worker, you need to implement two event handlers:

* `install`
* `activate`

These events are fired once for a service worker in a particular scope, no matter 
how many clients use it.

### Install

Use the install event to get everything this service worker needs to operate.
This could include initializing caches, or prefetching data.

The install event is kicked off immediately after the script containing it is
downloaded.

{% highlight javascript %}
self.addEventListener('install', function(installEvent) {
  installEvent.waitUntil(
    // Prefetch resources and initialize data stores.
  );
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Activate

Use activate to clean up after a previous version of a service worker. This may
include migrating data in ways that can't be done while the old service worker
was active. This event is **not** called when a terminated service worker is
revived.

{% highlight javascript %}
self.addEventListener('activate', function(activateEvent) {
  activateEvent.waitUntil(
    // Actions not covered by this primer.
  );
});
{% endhighlight %}

## The user navigates

Now that the service worker is installed, it's doing something for our page,
right? Not quite. For the service worker to start handling requests, it 
needs a call to <code>clients.claim()</code> or the user needs to navigate. 
For the later, you can either you can wait for the user to open another page 
in the same scope or you can ask the user to reload.

{% include shared/remember.liquid title="Aside" list=page.notes.sws-dont-control %}

## The waitUntil() method

You might've noticed that both the install and activate events contain a method
named `waitUntil()`. This method prevents server workers from getting in their
own way. In the install event it delays firing of the activate event. In the
activate event it delays other service worker events. This method takes something
that resolves to a promsie. If you don't want to wait for a promsie to resolve
you can leave it out.

But a promise to what? Before answering, let's take a detour and talk about
debugging.
